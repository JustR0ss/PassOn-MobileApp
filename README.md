Project I messed around with in May 2015. Android native code. 
Users brought to a screen similar to paint, could draw add pictures.
Users could then click send to be displayed with a compass that turned when you change direction.
Users could swipe in the direction and send directions and message to a server.
The server would use projectile calculations to determine other users on app in that direction.
